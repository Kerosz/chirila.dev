## Overview

A node is a basic data structure which contain data and one or more pointers/links to other nodes. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of many computer science data structures. They form the basis for linked lists, stacks, queues, trees and more.

## Implementation

The node for a singly linked list has 2 bits, a data part and a link part. The data part will contain any kind of value and the link will contain the address of next node and is initialized to null.

```tsx[class="line-numbers"]:single-pointer-node.tsx
class Node<T> {
  public data: T;
  public next: Node<T> | null;

  constructor(data: T) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

The node for a doubly linked list has 3, a data part and 2 link parts *(previous and next)*. This particular node is useful for backtracking but it takes double memory size compared to the single pointer Node.

```tsx[class="line-numbers"]:double-pointer-node.tsx
class Node<T> {
  public data: T;
  public prev: Node<T> | null;
  public next: Node<T> | null;

  constructor(data: T) {
    this.data = data;
    this.prev = null;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```
