The new version of my site brings a minimalist design into the mix and aims to showcase myself, my thoughts and my writtings. It has been a journey to get here but finally I opened the door wide.

## In the makings

I've always struggled with finishing side projects. While I can say I love experimenting and trying out new things thus forming my own opinions, which usually leads to a lot of unfinished products, as shipping a **good enough** product requires a lot of work, which requires a lot of time, time I cannot afford to spend on these projects.

To be honest is the good old trap that `it's always something you can do to improve it`. So I'm glad that I made myself finish this new space version no matter how many challanges I had to face, **time wise**.

In the making of this space I used technologies that I've enjoyed lately, including:

- Next.js (`v11`)
- Tailwind CSS (Recently switched from `styled-components / emotion`)
- `next-mdx-remote`
- GreenStock Animations
- Zustand (Light state management)
- Deployed with Vercel

## Next.js 11

Next.js is one of my favorite tools to use lately, **vercel team** is killing on the developer experience (DX). I probably can name just a few things that made the making of this website simple and intuitive, these being their [Page Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages), their [getStaticProps for Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation), as well as [Image Component and Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization).

When it comes to under-the-hood optimizations next is one of the best for sure. Their `Image` component gives you a big helping hand in preventing [Cumulative Layout Shifts](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS) by providing a fixed `width` and `height` to the media, loading it as it reaches the viewport and serving it using modern formats like [WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) when supported, all these makes the page be really fast as we all know media is one to provide a big performance hit to most websites.

## Tailwind css

For a long time I've been a fan of CSS-in-JS solutions like `styled-components` or `emotion` and I thought `tailwindcss` is just `bootstrap`, so I was reticent of trying it out, all until [@karlhadwen](https://twitter.com/karlhadwen) introduced me to it, since then I've used tailwind in a few projects and I can say I have a strong opinion on the matter, **I love it**.

In short, `tailwindcss` allows you to have a good, reliable and really thought out system design while making the development process fast, simple and intuitive.

There is a small learning curve in using it, mostly by rewiring your existing CSS knowledge into CSS utility classes. The transition can be easier by using IDE tools like [IntelliSense for Tailwind CSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss). As a small example we can look at how we can convert some CSS:

```css:styles.css
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
padding: 80px 12px;
```

into tailwind utility classes:

```tsx:tailwind.tsx
<section className="mx-auto py-20 px-3" />
```

## MDX

As a developer, my personal favorite way of writting content is `markdown` so it was an easy decision on how I want my data to be sourced. `next-mdx-remote` along with `getStaticPaths` from **next.js** allows you to treat your `.mdx` files as you would treat any data in your application, being able to query it and statically build it from remote sources.

This approach keeps your mdx files separated from your application, in my case I chose to store my content into a top level folder `/data`.

More then this `next-mdx-remote` makes it simple to use **remark and rehype plugins** which enhances the content processing, pairing this with tailwind `prose` utility class makes you have a fully featured blog with a few lines of code.

```tsx:mdx.tsx
const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      require('remark-code-titles'),
      require('remark-slug'),
      require('remark-autolink-headings'),
      require('remark-prism'),
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [require('mdx-prism')],
  },
});
```

```tsx:post.tsx
<div className='prose max-w-none w-full'>
  {content}
</div>
```

## GreenStock Animation (GSAP)

`gsap` is a fast, robust library that can be used in a lot of environments, including `react`. I've chose to go with GreenStock for animations over something like `framer-motion` (which I've also used in the past) because it makes the developer work simple and has a big user impact. Over the years **gsap team** released [multiple useful plugins](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins) for easly creating animations along their core [tween](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) and [timeline](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) functions.

I've heard multiple opinions that are against using `gsap` with `react` but I find it's usage being very simple, as the exemple below will illustrate:

```tsx:header.tsx
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  if (introComplete) {
    const tl = gsap.timeline();

    // using a react ref instead of a class name
    tl.to(headerRef.current, {
      y: 0,
      duration: 0.1,
      ease: 'expo.out',
      delay: 0.11,
    });
    // awaiting gsap to finish the animation and do something
    tl.then(() => setLocalAnimationComplete(true));
  }
}, [introComplete]);
```

## Zustand

All I can say about `zustand` is that it is a very well thought library and a persoanl varorite when I have to deal with a light global state. It's based on [flux principles](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and it pairs really well with `react` as they have an API based on **react-hooks pattern**. It only renders components when changes are done to the part of the state that it's being used in that particular component and it **does not** wrap your application in [Context Providers](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). 

The usage is intuitive and simple (which you might get that it's a theme among all the tools I use), let's look on how we can create a store with `zustand`:

```tsx:store.tsx
export const useStore = create(
  combine(
    {
      introComplete: false,
    },
    (set) => ({
      setIntroComplete: () => set({ introComplete: true }),
    })
  )
);
```
to use our state in a component we make use of the **useStore** hook:

```tsx:component.tsx
const {  introComplete } = useStore();
```
### Conclusion

The new space version is a personal slice of the internet, a place to share my writtings and post things I learn along my journey. So, **here it is**, I hope you will enjoy your time with me and if you want to disagree with anything I say shoot me a DM on twitter [@chirila_](https://twitter.com/chirila_) and I would be happy debate.
