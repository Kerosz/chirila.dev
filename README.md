# Personal website

## Introduction

Being a web developer without a personal website is being like a business man without a business card, so I took action and got myself a little something right here.

## Codebase

### Technologies

The entire codebase consists in **Typescript**

Here is a list of technologies used:

- **Nextjs/React**: Front-end framework

### Folder structure

```sh
personal-website/
├── components     # Reusable parts
├── constants      # Static data
├── lib            # External helpers
├── pages          # Application views
└── public         # Media assets
```
